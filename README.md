# IB2 - Iot device

Project done for the class of Engineering Experience II @ Group T - Faculty of Engineering Technology / academic year 2021-22
Alarm Clock & Coffee machine connected with Raspberry Pi.

## Description

Students typically drink a lot of coffee but preparing it in the morning while your housemates try to start their day in the kitchen can be cumbersome. 
If a student could schedule when they want their coffee and just have it there, ready, waiting for them when they wake up, life would be much easier. 
That is exactly what ICoffee proposes to do. This projects has two sides: The alarm clock part, described in this repo and the desktop application part that can
be found [here](https://github.com/avidadearthur/iCoffee).
